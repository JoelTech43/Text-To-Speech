# Text-To-Speech
A simple text to speech program in python.

#Installation/Use
1) Download the files.

2) Go to directory where it is downloaded and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3) Run the file using:
```
python main.py
```
4)Type what you want and hit enter. Type exit to exit.

As a little side note, the program creates a temporary mp3 file. This is deleted if you exit by entering exit but not if you kill the program.
If you do just close the window, just delete the mp3 file as it is useless and will be overwriten anyway.
